			<p>This game made me who I am. Maybe. Structurally it's a fairly conventional old school RPG but it's so much more than that. The world, writing, and characters are all weird, funny, and delightful. It's currently playable on Nintendo Switch but I think the Wii U promotional video they made is more interesting to watch.</p>
